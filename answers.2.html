                <li>ANSWER 1<br>
                Once you place an order, Simpl will send you a link via SMS and Email. You can use that link to make the payment before Simpl’s fixed due dates - which is the 1st and 16th of every month</li><br>

                <li>ANSWER 2<br>
                Let’s take the month of July as an example.
                All your orders received from the 1st to the 15th of the month will be recorded in one bill, which will be generated on the 15th evening. You will then have to settle it by the next day (16th July)
                Orders received from the 16th to the end of the month​ ​(31st in this is case), will be recorded in the next bill,​ ​which will generated on the 31st​ ​(last day of the month). Again, you will then have to settle it by the next day​ ​(1st August).</li><br>

                <li>ANSWER 4<br>
                In a year, a user will be charged if he/she defaults more than twice. According to Simpl's legal team, missing the due date by more than 7 days is termed a default. So in a year, a user will be charged Rs. 250 per default, from the third default onwards. However, the 7 days it takes to default is purely a legal definition. Your spending limit may go down even if you consistently miss the payment date by 1 day.
                If the above policy undergoes major changes, you will be the first to know. We hate hidden charges as much as you.</li><br>
